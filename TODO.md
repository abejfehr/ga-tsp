✓ anti-alias the lines
✓ fill the circles
✓ remove old lines when drawing a new set of lines
✓ explicitly start the simulation with a button press, instead of just having the randomized paths initially
✓ show the best few things in the current generation
✓ Make the nodes on the screen smaller
✓ use custom canvas code to draw the graph
✓ make the sections a little nicer looking

- make the previews of the top 5 the same aspect ratio
- show what generation is currently on screen
- show whether the current solution is optimal or not
  - how? idk look into it I guess
- let users control a few parameters (mutation rate, etc)
